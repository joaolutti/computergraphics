CPSC 453 Assignment 3 - Joao Lutti 30155249

I didn't forget a README this time!

V to switch between scenes, goes 2D curve editor -> 3D curve viewer -> 3D surface of revolution -> 3D tensor surface viewers and then back to 2D curve editor
In 2D curve editor, C to change between bezier and b-spline curves (starts with bezier as default), left-click to add points, left-click and drag a point to move it, right-click on a point to remove it. Press R to remove all points.
Most recently added point is highlighted in blue, and all other points are in red.
In any 3D scene, left-click and drag in any direction to move the camera, scroll in or out to zoom in/out. In 3D surface of revolution or tensor surface scenes, press W to toggle the wireframe.
In the 3D tensor surfaces scene, use the left and right arrow keys to switch between the two different surfaces.
Press R to reset the camera in any 3D scene.

I didn't use the curve editor panel at all, but I still left it there as it was part of the boilerplate, but it does nothing

I made the assignment using Windows 11 in Visual Studio, and used the default CMake compiler.
Thanks!! :D
