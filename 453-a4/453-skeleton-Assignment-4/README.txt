CPSC 453 Assignment 4 - Joao Lutti 30155249

To control the spherical camera:
	Scroll wheel zooms in and out on the cube
	Holding the right mouse button and dragging allows you to rotate the camera around the current selected planet
I did the bonus to center the turntable camera on different planets/moons.
In order to change the turntable camera's center to another planet:
	1 key press: Sun (default on program start)
	2 key press: Earth
	3 key press: Moon

Press space to pause/unpause the program, and use the up/down arrows to increase/decrease the orbital speeds of the planets.

For the shading part, I utilized this website that helped quite a bit: https://learnopengl.com/Lighting/Basic-Lighting

I made the assignment using Windows 11 in Visual Studio, and used the default CMake compiler.
Thanks! :)
